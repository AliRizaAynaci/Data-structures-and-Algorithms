## Merge Sort Algorithm Example

Let's walk through the Merge Sort algorithm step by step using the array: [7, 3, 5, 8, 2, 9, 4, 15, 6].

### Initial Array

Our unsorted array is: [7, 3, 5, 8, 2, 9, 4, 15, 6].

### Step 1: Divide

1. Start by dividing the array into smaller subarrays until each subarray contains only one element.

### Step 2: Merge

2. Merge the subarrays back together in a sorted manner.

### Continue Steps 3-5

Continue these steps recursively until the entire array is sorted:

### Step 3: Divide

Divide the subarrays further.

### Step 4: Merge

Merge the subarrays.

### Step 5: Sorted Array

The Merge Sort algorithm has sorted the array in ascending order: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 15].

## Complexity Analysis

The Merge Sort algorithm has the following time and space complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: Merge Sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst-case scenario. It consistently performs well, even for large datasets, making it a good choice for sorting.

- **Space Complexity**: Merge Sort has a space complexity of O(n). It requires additional memory for creating temporary subarrays during the merge step.

Merge Sort is a stable and efficient sorting algorithm, making it a preferred choice for applications where stable sorting and good performance are essential.
