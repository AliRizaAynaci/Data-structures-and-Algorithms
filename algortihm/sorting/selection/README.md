# Selection Sort Algorithm

### The Selection Sort algorithm works as follows:

---

- Start by selecting the first element of the array.
- Search for the smallest element among the remaining elements in the array.
- When the smallest element is found, swap it with the first element.
- Move on to the second element of the array and repeat steps 2 and 3 to find the second smallest element, swapping it
with  the second element.
- Continue this process for the remaining elements in the array until the entire array is sorted.

If this process is repeated for all elements in the array, the array will be sorted in ascending order.
