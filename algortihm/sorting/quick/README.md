## Quick Sort Algorithm Example

Let's walk through the Quick Sort algorithm step by step using the array: [7, 3, 5, 8, 2, 9, 4, 15, 6].

### Initial Array

Our unsorted array is: [7, 3, 5, 8, 2, 9, 4, 15, 6].

### Step 1: Partition

1. Choose a pivot element, let's say 6.
2. Reorder the array so that all elements less than the pivot come before it, and all elements greater than the pivot come after it. In this case, the array becomes: [3, 5, 2, 4], [6], [7, 8, 9, 15].

### Step 2: Recursion

3. Recursively apply Quick Sort to the subarrays on the left and right of the pivot.

### Continue Steps 3-5

Continue these steps recursively until the entire array is sorted:

### Step 3: Partition

Partition the subarrays.

### Step 4: Recursion

Recursively apply Quick Sort to the subarrays.

### Step 5: Sorted Array

The Quick Sort algorithm has sorted the array in ascending order: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 15].

## Complexity Analysis

The Quick Sort algorithm has the following time and space complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: Quick Sort has an average and best-case time complexity of O(n log n). In the worst case, it can degrade to O(n^2), but this is rare with good pivot selection strategies.

- **Space Complexity**: Quick Sort has a space complexity of O(log n) for the recursive call stack. It is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it doesn't require additional memory allocation for data structures.

Quick Sort is an efficient sorting algorithm, especially for large datasets, and is widely used in practice due to its average-case performance.
